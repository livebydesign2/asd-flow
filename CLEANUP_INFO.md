## Why Clean Up Template Files?

### 👍 Benefits of Cleanup
1. **Clean Project Structure** - No confusion about what files are yours vs. template files
2. **Professional Appearance** - Project looks production-ready, not template-based
3. **Clear Focus** - Team focuses on your project files, not template setup
4. **Reduced Clutter** - No unnecessary files in your repository
5. **Clear Ownership** - Everything remaining is specific to your project

### 🛡️ Safety Guarantees
- **Your customized content is never touched** - Only template setup files are removed
- **AI workflows remain intact** - All AI-first development processes stay
- **Feature templates stay** - You can still create new features using the templates
- **Architecture decisions preserved** - Your customized ADRs remain
- **No functionality lost** - Only setup/instruction files are removed

## When to Run Cleanup

**✅ Safe to run cleanup when:**
- All template variables have been replaced with your project info
- `node validate-template.js` passes successfully
- External documentation structure is set up
- You've tested the AI workflows with your project
- Team understands the AI-first development process

**⚠️ Wait to run cleanup if:**
- Template variables still exist (`{{VARIABLE_NAME}}`)
- Validation script is failing
- External docs aren't set up yet
- You might want to reference setup instructions again
- Team hasn't been trained on the workflows yet

## Backup Strategy (Optional)

If you want to keep template setup files for reference:

```bash
# Create backup folder
mkdir template-backup

# Copy template files before cleanup
cp TEMPLATE_CONFIG.md SETUP_GUIDE.md EXTERNAL_DOCS_SETUP.md template-backup/

# Then run cleanup
node cleanup-template-files.js

# Template files are backed up in template-backup/ folder
```

## Recovery

If you need template setup files after cleanup:
1. **Re-download the original template** from source
2. **Copy the setup files** you need back to your project
3. **Don't re-run the customization** - your project files are already customized

The cleanup process is designed to be **safe, clear, and reversible** while giving you a clean, professional project structure focused on your specific needs.
